# An Overview of Parameter and Data Strategies for k-Nearest Neighbours Based Short-Term Traffic Prediction
We examine the relations among three k NN parameters, which are:
number of nearest neighbours (*k*), search step length (*d*) and window size (*v*). 
We also analysed predict step ahead (*m*) which is not a parameter but a user requirement and configuration.


# Usage of Code
(The code will be updated.)


# Results
The analyses indicate that the relations among parameters are compound especially when traffic low states are considered.
We suggest considering all parameter strategies simultaneously as ensemble strategies especially by including *v* together with *k* and *d* in flow-aware strategies
